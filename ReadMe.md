You'll also want to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

Once complete the following tools should be available on your system.

- Git
- Expo

You can check installation by running the following commands:

```
node --version
npm --version
git --version
expo --version
```
